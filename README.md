# AI-Powered-EDA-Automation-Tool


LLM-Powered EDA Data Analyzer App â€“ Data Science & Web Development Project

* Developed an interactive web application using Gradio and Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on uploaded datasets, integrating the Mistral LLM via Ollama for AI-driven insights.
* Implemented data preprocessing with Pandas, handling missing values by filling numerical columns with medians and categorical columns with modes, ensuring robust data analysis.
* Generated comprehensive EDA reports, including statistical summaries and missing value counts, enhanced with AI-generated insights to identify trends and patterns in the data.
* Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including histograms for numerical distributions and a correlation heatmap, saved as dynamic images for user review.
* Utilized temporary file handling with tempfile to manage plot outputs, ensuring scalability and clean resource management in the application.
* Demonstrated expertise in data visualization, machine learning integration, and web app development, delivering a user-friendly tool for data exploration and interpretation.
